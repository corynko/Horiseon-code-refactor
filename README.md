Challenge Repo for Week 1 DU Bootcamp

## Changes Made

### HTML

Most of the required changes to the HTML of the site consisted of replacing non-semantic elements with semantic elements. This, in addition to making the code easier to work on in the future, will make the page easier to parse for people using screen-readers and other assistive devices, as well as improving SEO by highlighting elements to search engine crawlers.

Additionally, the broken Search-Engine-Optimization anchor tag in the nav-bar was fixed, and the site now has a proper title which should dramatically improve SEO rankings.

### CSS

Most of my changes in the CSS file reflect my consolidation of extraneous or redundant rule-sets in order to make the code easier to read and edit in the future.

I took great care to ensure the site is identical to how it was before any changes were made, while making the code significantly easier for a new dev to parse in the future. Additionally, some changes (especially to benefits classes and the new service-offerings-left/right classes) will make it significantly easier to maintain consistent formatting should new services be added in the future.
